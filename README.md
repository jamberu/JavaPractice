### [Cellphone](Cellphone.java) <sub>Assigned by Prof | 10-25-2023</sub>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A simple program that simulates a cellphone communication. It has features of SMS messaging, miss calls, call, reload, and recharge. The features are simple demonstrations of manipulating varialble values (subtracting and adding balance and battery). 

### [Tic Tac Toe](TicTacToe.java) <sub>Took interest | 10-25-2023</sub>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A simple program that requires 2 users to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. Starting player is randomized. Has bout feature (best of 3, 5, ...). Referenced GeeksforGeeks' TicTacToe tutorial and added my twists.
