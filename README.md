A repository for me to compile all my Java practices

### [Cellphone](Cellphone.java) <sub>Assigned by Prof | 10-25-2023</sub>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A simple program that simulates a cellphone communication. It has features of SMS messaging, miss calls, call, reload, and recharge.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A simple program that summate the numbers below a certain set limit. The limit can not be negative or zero. Added my twist wherein I applied recursion as an alternative method in the summation process.

### [Minimum](Minimum.java) <sub>Assigned by Prof | 06-11-2023</sub>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A simple program that receives a constant 3 input from the user and checks which input is the smallest among the 3.
